# End-to-End ML Project 
## Student Exam Performance
This repo includes an end-to-end ML project. The focus is mainly on deployment rather than the difficulty of the dataset. 

The dataset is *Student exam performance* from [Kaggles](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams?datasetId=74977) and the prediction type is regression. 

This repo was cloned from my repo [ML-end-to-end-azure](https://github.com/AsiehH/ML-end-to-end-azure) and only the deployment part was changed from Microsoft Azure to AWS.

## Run locally
- From the project directory run:

	`python app.py`

- On your browser navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8080/predictdata`
